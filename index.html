						<p>Multi-national construction firm Laing O’Rourke is leading the Freight Connect consortium, which includes Toowoomba-based FKG Group, and has committed to working with local businesses and leaving a legacy after works have been completed.</p>
						<p>And a large local workforce to support this part of the project will be needed, with an estimated 500 workers on deck at the peak of construction.</p>
						<p>ARTC Inland Rail interim CEO Rebecca Pickering said the appointment of the consortium, in parallel with environmental planning approvals, would allow local businesses to hit the ground running when formal approval is given.</p>

						<p>“Freight Connect will soon be seeking partnerships with businesses and skilled operators that can support project delivery such as transport operators, fencing, quarries, earthworks and electrical companies,” she said.</p>
						<p>The appointment of Freight Connect now also allows them to maximise local jobs and procurement before work is expected to begin next year.</p>
						<p>“Our business has long and deep relationships in both Queensland and NSW stretching over 50 years where we have delivered a number of major projects and we are delighted to be granted the opportunity to play our part in this once-in-a-generation piece of infrastructure,” Laing O’Rourke Managing Director Cathal O’Rourke said.</p>
						<p><b>This part of the Inland Rail project will build approximately 100km of rail corridor within the southern end of Border to Gowrie, North Star to Border and Narrabri to North Star sections of Inland Rail, including the bridge that spans the Macintyre River which serves as the border between the two states.”</b></p>

						<p>A fully costed proposal for the first of the works packages is expected next year. The ARTC also confirmed a Brisbane-based joint venture made up of Bielby Holdings Pty Ltd, JF Hull Holdings Pty Ltd and QH&M Birt Pty Ltd would deliver civil works for more than 160km of rail line from Yelarbon at the NSW/Queensland border to Gowrie Junction near Toowoomba.</p>

						<p>The $14.5 billion, 1700km Inland Rail, one of Australia’s largest ever infrastructure projects, will connect Melbourne to Brisbane, and would allow the delivery of goods in about 24 hours.</p>
						<p>But it has not been without controversies, with ongoing campaigns to change the route through Millmerran and Cecil Plains and a push for it to terminate at Gladstone, rather than Brisbane.</p>
						<p>Inland Rail has already committed 641 contracts to businesses in Queensland and 657 in NSW worth more than $1.95 billion across the two states.</p>
